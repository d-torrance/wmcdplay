Description: CD player based on ascd designed for WindowMaker
 There's nothing in the program that makes it *require* WindowMaker,
 except maybe the look. It's extremely customizable, provides great
 control, and runs on a 64x64 window. You can get it too look almost
 like anything, provided of course you READ the documentation.
