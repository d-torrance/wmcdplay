RELEASE HISTORY:
================

Release 0.1    22/01/98    Poor window repaint technique.
                           Incorrect display if paused on startup.
                           Does not show Tray Open if opened by button on drive,
                              (I think this can only be done if the drive is empty).

Release 0.2    23/01/98    Improved window repaints.
                           Correct display even if paused on startup.
                           Improved interface on 'other' window managers.

Release 0.3    07/02/98    Handles multisession CD properly.
                           Now free's ALL pixmaps on exit (i hope).
                           And GCs :-).
                           Major re-write and interface alterations.
                           Option for led display color.
                           Smaller and better written.

                              Basic pixmap,
                              How many buttons,
                              Size, shape, position of buttons (polygons),
                              Actions for each button in each state:
                                 (Stop, Stop Data, Play, Pause, Ejected),
                              Led and symbol pixmaps,
                              Position of displays.

                           Random/Repeat track selection.

                           Reduced CPU load (thanks to aseltine@cd.umass.edu),
                           It wasn't high on my K6 233MHz box :-).

                           Added "-b back_color" command line argument,
                              ("-b darkslategrey -l cyan" gives a nice backlit look).
                           Reduced cpu load.
                           Relative or absolute time display,
                              (click time display to switch).
                           More changes to artwork:
                              Led pixmaps now part of artwork,
                              Symbolic color names can now be used in all pixmaps:
                                 led_color_high,
                                 led_color_med,
                                 led_color_low,
                                 color_back.
                              All pixmaps now use standard names:
                                 cdplayer.xpm = cdplayer_xpm,
                                 symbols.xpm  = symbols_xpm,
                                 led.xpm      = led_xpm,
                                 ledsym.xpm   = ledsym_xpm,
                                 ledtsel.xpm  = ledtsel_xpm.
                              Entries specifying symbol dimensions no longer needed,
                              "symbols.xpm" now includes a symbol for NOTHING,
                              New piece of artwork, "newstyle.art",
                              New directory structure and scripts.
                           Track selection should be more reliable now.

Release 1.0    05/09/98    Added some error checking.
Beta1                      "-a artwork_file" is now "-f artwork_file", sorry ;-).
                           Added "-a" command line argument for AfterStep users.
                           Added "-position position" command line argument.
                           Command line arguments, "-a", "-w" and "-s" are now toggle,
                             so if you enable one at compile-time, you can override
                             it at run-time.
                           Track selection actually works now??
                              (anyone notice a recurring theme here??)
                           Seperate update interval for when drive is empty.
                              (thanks to .....)
                           Fixed problem with (some?) SCSI devices refusing to
                              give LBA values. Thanks to the linux ide-scsi-emulator.
                           Now looks in some known directories for artwork files as
                              a last resort.
                           Improved artwork loading (it was very brain-dead).
                           Formatting changes in artwork files (ARTWORK documentation
                              is now up-to-date).

Release 1.1    18/12/14    Add -i option so users can specify cd polling
                              interval.
                           Fix compiler warnings.
                           Add FreeBSD and Hurd support.
                           Switch build system to autotools.
                           Install art script.
                           Add manpage from Debian.
