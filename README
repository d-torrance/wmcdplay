TRACK SELECTION:
================

Release 0.6 introduced track selection.

Actually, track selection is a slightly more logical version of the random/repeat
functions found in Creative Labs' SB16 software suite for win95.

The major change is that the previous releases just played from current position
to the end of the cd.
Now we play a single track, and when you set the track selection mode, you just
tell the cd player what to do at the end of the track. Here are the options:
0    None     - just stop
1    Next     - play next (audio) track (stop if end of cd)
2    Repeat   - play this track again
3    RepeatCD - play next (audio) track (start from first track if end of cd)
4    Random   - select an audio track at random and play it

The led display symbols for the modes are now part of the artwork file.
The mode defaults to Next, but can be changed with the "-t track_selection" command
line argument, or by clicking on the track selection mode led display.

The main consequence of this approach is that when using Random, you will
probably here a track twice before every track on the cd has been played once.
(Most cd players have a playlist listing all tracks in a randomized order)
Also, wmcdplay will always begin with track 1.
Furthermore, the Next and Prev buttons will always move through track numbers on the
cd (rather than, for instance, selecting random tracks).


AFTERSTEP USERS:
================
(thanks to tygris@erols.com)

This release includes in a new command line option (actually, its "-a"
and artwork files are now loaded with "-f artwork_file").
The effect this has is to enable shape support (it implies "-s"), and
to reduce the size of the window to 56x56 pixels.
The "-position position" option has also been added, so you can push
wmcdplay off the edge of the screen while it gets swallowed.
To put wmmount in your Wharf, add the following line in the appropriate
part of your .steprc

*Wharf wmmount nil MaxSwallow "wmmount" wmmount -a -position -0-0 &

It is also possible (by editing and recompiling the afterstep sources),
to make Wharf handle the new 56x56 pixel window properly - yes, I add
an option to use a 56x56 pixel window, even though the AfterStep Wharf
really wants 55x57 pixel ones.

I am told (by tygris@erols.com):

"Locate Wharf.c (or is it Wharf.cc?)  Should be in
AfterStep-1.0/modules/Wharf.  Locate this:

            if (Buttons[button].maxsize) {
              Buttons[button].icons[0].w = 55;
              Buttons[button].icons[0].h = 57;
            }

and change the 55 and 57 to 56's.  Save and compile."


BUILD PROBLEMS:
===============

You may have trouble linking wmmount with the compiler supplied on some
recent distributions (eg. Debian 2.0 & RedHat 5.1).
It can be made to build by adding the following line to the top of the
Imakefile, before executing xmkmf:

CC = c++

I am not sure of the effect this has on memory usage, etc.
